# Metaverse Dashboard (Codename Iamus)

**Notice: Marked for deprecation, will be replaced with https://github.com/vircadia/vircadia-web/ which will include both this dashboard's features and a full featured web client for visiting virtual worlds in Vircadia. As a result, this repository is currently being maintained but no new features are being added.**

## deployment

A consideration for deployment is that this is an SPA (single page application) and therefore will require a simple server-side [configuration](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html) change in the case of a page refresh.
